    Unlike other areas of economic study, health economics has a clear origin with \citet{arrow1963uncertainty}, who highlighted the issue of medical-care insurance, particularly information problems. In this research, the focus is on the Colombian health system and the interactions, incentives, and behaviors among the \textit{Health Promoting Entities (EPS)}, patients, and the government.
